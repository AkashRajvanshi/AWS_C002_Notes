# Shared responsibility.

Responsibiltiy is shared between AWS and Customer.

- There are thing facilities provided to us, and there are facilities we use which sits above facilities provide to us.

- E.g. In case of EC2, we are provided everything upto hardware, and from OS to App, we use EC2 for that (Like VM, OS, Storage, App, DB etc.).

- E.g. In case of Lambfa, we are provided everything upto Storage, we use code and APP on top of that.

- What are we provided is AWS's responsibility to make it secure, useful and available **to us**.

- And what we use is our responsibility to make it secure, useful and available **to our customer**.

- And a sum product from this shared responsibility is provided as end solution.
