# Definition of Cloud

## My Own understanding
| Term | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| On Demand Self Service | New resource provision and old resource termination without human intervention using CLI |
| Broad Network Access | Access Server to any network & standard mechanisms, like http(s), ssh, cli etc standard protocols and methods |
| Resource Pooling | Loction independence, no control or knowledge of exact location of server, but high level selection (like ap-south-1 aka mumbai) is available, these resource should be pooled to multiple consumers in multi tenant mode |
| Rapid Elasticity | Capablilities can be scaled up or down automatically and swiftly, and capabilites can appear to be unlimited |
| Measured Service | Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed. Billing should be on demand |
